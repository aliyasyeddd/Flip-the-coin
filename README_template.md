### What I learned
In this Project i have learned Dom manipulation
- how to control the css class and ids by adding functionality to them
- by using ids adding event listener

### Useful resources
 
 - Mdn  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) - this helped me to add event listener for button 
 - W3schools (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-font-border/) - for adding font stroke
 - Mdn (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes) - this helped me to check whether the src includes which url
